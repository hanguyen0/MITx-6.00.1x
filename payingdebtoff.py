# Test Case 1:
	      balance = 42
	      annualInterestRate = 0.2
	      monthlyPaymentRate = 0.04
	      
	      # Result Your Code Should Generate Below:
	      Remaining balance: 31.38
                    
          # To make sure you are doing calculation correctly, this is the 
          # remaining balance you should be getting at each month for this example
            Month 1 Remaining balance: 40.99
            Month 2 Remaining balance: 40.01
            Month 3 Remaining balance: 39.05
            Month 4 Remaining balance: 38.11
            Month 5 Remaining balance: 37.2
            Month 6 Remaining balance: 36.3
            Month 7 Remaining balance: 35.43
            Month 8 Remaining balance: 34.58

            Month 10 Remaining balance: 32.94
            Month 11 Remaining balance: 32.15
            Month 12 Remaining balance: 31.38
            
Monthly interest rate= (Annual interest rate) / 12.0
Minimum monthly payment = (Minimum monthly payment rate) x (Previous balance)
Monthly unpaid balance = (Previous balance) - (Minimum monthly payment)
Updated balance each month = (Monthly unpaid balance) + (Monthly interest rate x Monthly unpaid balance)

For each month:
Compute the monthly payment, based on the previous monthâ€™s balance.
Update the outstanding balance by removing the payment, then charging interest on the result.
Output the month, the minimum monthly payment and the remaining balance.
Keep track of the total amount of paid over all the past months so far.
Print out the result statement with the total amount paid and the remaining balance.
